# Week 5 – GIF & Remix Culture

## The Artifact
Describe or embed your artifact here.
Include images, links, or media as appropriate.

## Process Notes
How did you make this? I used the app GIPHY CAPTURE to make this gif loop for me. 
What tools did you use? GIPHY CAPTURE
What decisions did you make? I decided what should change and happen inside the loop

## Reflection
When an image repeats instead of staying still, it starts to feel different. At first, Snoopy jumping on the doghouse feels fun and playful. It looks like a normal cartoon moment. But once it keeps looping, the jump doesn’t feel as spontaneous anymore. It starts to feel automatic, like it’s stuck in a cycle. The butterfly flying in circles under him makes that feeling stronger because it never breaks its pattern.The loop makes you notice the structure of the animation instead of just the scene. After watching it a few times, it feels less like a cute moment and more like something programmed. The repetition kind of removes the surprise. It turns play into a pattern. My human choices show up in picking Snoopy, deciding how high he jumps, how fast the butterfly moves, and how long the loop lasts. Even if AI helped generate the image, I still controlled how it moves and what repeats. The automation is visible in how smooth and perfect the loop is. It doesn’t change or react, it just continues. Since Snoopy comes from Peanuts, this GIF is already a remix. Using AI adds another layer because it’s not the original drawing by Charles Schulz, but a new version created through prompts. That makes authorship more complicated. It’s partly mine, partly AI, and partly based on something that already exists.
