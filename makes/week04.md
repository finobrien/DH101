## Reflection
For this comic, I wanted to show a simple moment between two friends playing and racing each other. Without digging deeper, it’s just about simple competition, but it’s really about effort and fairness. When one of them cheats a little to win, it makes the victory feel less meaningful due to how they go there. By the last panel, they decide to race again “for real,” which shows that actually trying is what makes something “true”. Even though the story itself isn’t about AI, I did use AI to help me come up with the final captions for what the characters would say. I asked for a few different lines and then chose the one that matched best to the overall meaning of the story. The idea and characters were mine, but AI helped me edit the wording. That made me realize that AI works best for me as a tool, not as the creator. If it had written the whole comic, it wouldn’t feel personal or connected to what I wanted to say. This project showed me that meaning comes from the choices I make. AI can suggest ideas, but I’m the one who decides what fits and what doesn’t.
