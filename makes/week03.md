## Reflection
In the AI-generated selfie, I can see myself in some obvious ways, like my age, hair, and the fact that I look like a college student. The setting and overall look definitely match how I described myself. At the same time, a lot of me is missing, almost like it's missing what makes me me. The image feels too generic, like it could be almost anyone my age. It doesn’t show my personality, interests, or anything that makes me different from other students. The AI turns my identity into a simple set of traits instead of a real person. When I changed my eye color from hazel to blue in the second version, it made this even clearer. That one small change made the image feel noticeably different, even though nothing about who I actually am changed. It showed me how easily AI can edit identity and how much importance it places on appearance. Eye color became just another adjustable detail, which made my identity feel kind of “artificial”. What stood out most to me is how the AI fills in gaps without really knowing me. It assumes what a “19 year old college kid” should look like and produces an ideal version that feels more like a stock photo than a selfie. This made me realize that the image isn’t really about me, it’s about the system’s idea of someone like me. The process shows how AI can flatten identity and reinforce assumptions instead of representing people accurately or fully.
