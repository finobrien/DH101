## Reflection
I think don't think the “making” part of this project is about building the website or making the maps. It’s about all the decisions that were made in picking and how the data was sorted. For “Mapping the Republic of Letters”, it means deciding what letters to include, who sent and received them, and then deciding how to show the connections between them. These choices will shape what the final product looks like. Having machines involved can change things a lot. Computers can handle a lot of letters and show patterns that would be way too hard to notice otherwise. They can automatically create networks and maps, which is really interesting because you can see trends and connections. Machines don’t make the important choices themselves, humans decide what data to include, and how it’s presented. That means even though the maps look “machine built”, they’re still shaped by humans. I think this project shows that making with machines isn’t just about the computer doing all the work. Humans are the ones who are deciding what's important, and what the map actually says about history. “Making”, is really the research, data work, and thinking. It made me realize that even digital projects are full of human work and choices, not just fully generated or made by machines.
